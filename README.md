## NYC Green Taxi analysis
I used data from NYC OpenData to analyze Green Taxi usage for years 2020 and 2021. Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, the goal was to answer questions such as "when are taxis most commonly used?"

## 2005 Street Tree analysis
Using data from NYC OpenData, I wanted to provide the end user with useful information such as the most popular trees in NY, their health status, where they were located, etc.
